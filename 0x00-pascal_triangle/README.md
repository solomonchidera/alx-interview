## Pascal Triangle
This is a mathematical method that has been narrowed down to computer science due to relationship betwwen the field

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers that emerge from a specific pattern of addition, creating a symmetrical structure with each number being the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although its properties were studied centuries earlier by various mathematicians.

The triangle begins with a single 1 at the top, representing the initial value. Each subsequent row is formed by adding the two numbers directly above each position, moving from left to right. This addition rule results in a sequence of numbers that exhibit interesting patterns and properties.

Pascal's Triangle can be extended indefinitely, with each additional row following the same addition rule. This simple yet elegant structure has fascinated mathematicians and scientists for centuries, and it continues to find applications in various fields, including computer science and statistics.
